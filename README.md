## Sports Predictive Model Proposal 

[ Working Title: SPMP ]

Topic: What system will you be building?  
A predicative sports modeling system that predicts sports statistics for specific teams, players, games, etc.ie   

Motivation: Why are you selecting this?   
We are selecting this project because we have an interest in predictive modeling and its application in a field we all enjoy: sports.  

Primary Objective: What purpose will it serve? 
It will serve as a tool for analysts, franchise staff, and sports bettors to better understand and predict the short-term and long-term implications of NBA data.  

Functional Requirements: 
1. Users can use our system to look up players or team specific predicted data. 
2. Advanced Metrics such as box plus/minus and Player efficiency rating (PER) 
3. Data Visualization tools, such as heat-maps and graphs 
4. Feedback from users to improve requirements  

Non-functional Requirements:

1. The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, regardless of the userâ€™s technical expertise 
2. Operational from personal computer or mobile devices 
3. System should update its data daily 
4. The system should be able to handle large volumes of data and user queries with minimal latency. 
5. Predicted data should be returned almost instantly 
6. The system should be scalable, both in terms of handling an increasing amount of data over time and accommodating a growing number of users.
